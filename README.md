# Final Sprint (SD12 - First Semester) [Chess Player Statistics]

## Overview

This project demonstrates basic JavaScript skills by creating, reading, and displaying data from a JSON file. It focuses on manipulating JSON data and presenting it in both the browser console and HTML format.

## Features

- Custom JSON file creation with chess player data
- Reading JSON file using Fetch API
- Displaying JSON data in the browser console
- Formatting and presenting data in the browser window as HTML
- Multiple JavaScript functions to process and display data

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file that serves as the hosting page
- `scripts.js`: JavaScript file containing functions to process and display data
- `Chess_players.json`: JSON file with chess player statistics

## Learning Outcomes

1. **JSON File Creation**: Demonstrated by the `Chess_players.json` file containing various data types and multiple records.
2. **JavaScript and HTML Integration**: The `index.html` file includes the `scripts.js` file using the `<script>` tag.
3. **HTML Page Setup**: `index.html` serves as the hosting page that executes the embedded JavaScript.
4. **JSON File Reading**: Implemented in `scripts.js` using the Fetch API to read `Chess_players.json`.
5. **JSON Data Iteration**: `scripts.js` includes functions that iterate over JSON records and log information to the console.
6. **Data Formatting Functions**: Multiple functions in `scripts.js` format and emit record contents from the JSON file.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Open the browser's developer tools to view console output.
4. Observe the formatted data displayed on the webpage.

## Functions

- `findPopularOpening()`: Analyzes the most popular chess openings among players.
- `findHighestRatedPlayer()`: Determines the player with the highest rating.
- `getAchievementsByPlayer()`: Compiles a list of achievements for each player.
- `displayPopularOpenings()`: Renders popular openings data in HTML.
- `displayHighestRatedPlayer()`: Shows the highest-rated player information.
- `displayAchievementsByPlayer()`: Lists achievements for each player in HTML format.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more interactive elements to the webpage
- Implement sorting and filtering options for the displayed data
- Create visualizations (e.g., charts or graphs) of player statistics
